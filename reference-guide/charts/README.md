# Charts

As an admin user, KPIs are paramount to follow day by day. Your customers’ growth, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Paid VS Free accounts are some common examples.

### What types of charts exist in Forest Admin?

Forest Admin can render six types of charts:

* Single value (Number of customers, MRR, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (270).png>)

* Repartition (Number of customers by countries, Paid VS Free, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (271).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the 5 biggest categories will be displayed separately. All the others will go into a 6th "Other" category.
{% endhint %}

* Time-based (Number of signups per month, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (272).png>)

* Percentage (% of paying customers, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (273).png>)

* Objective (Orders passed per year VS objective, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (275).png>)

* Leaderboard (Companies who emitted the most transactions, …)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (274).png>)



Ensure you’ve enabled the `Layout Editor` mode to add, edit or delete a chart.

### Where can you add charts?

Charts can be added in 2 places:

* In your **Dashboard** tab
* In the **Analytics** tab of every record of a collection
