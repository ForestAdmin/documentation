# Forest Admin

Forest Admin instantly provides all common admin tasks such as CRUD operations, simple chart rendering, user group management, and [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) interface editor. That’s what makes Forest Admin a quick and easy solution to get your admin interface started.

This **documentation** assists developers and managers in having the admin completely tailored to cater to their specific needs. We’ve developed Forest Admin so that your admin is 100% customizable. It means that you have full control over your data, your back-end business logic and the UI.

Forest Admin provides a **very simple** API-based framework to handle all parts of your admin back-end configuration. You should be good to go in no time, with virtually no investments of time and resources.
