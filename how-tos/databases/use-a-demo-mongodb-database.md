# Use a demo MongoDB database

Want to try out Forest Admin with MongoDB but don't have a database to try it with?&#x20;

You can connect to our **demo MongoDB database**!

{% hint style="info" %}
You won't get the full Forest Admin experience as this database is read-only.
{% endhint %}

To connect, you'll need the following credentials:

* Host: `http://prod-howtobuildamongodb.x4fxi.mongodb.net/`
* User: `article`
* Password: `CAx3jRn%gx4Y3kts**VHBVYZRSx@`
* database: `sample_analytics`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don’t forget to tick **Use SRV** in the advanced settings.
{% endhint %}
