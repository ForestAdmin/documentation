# Plug multiple schemas

A **schema** is an organizational layer to better structure your SQL database.

At installation, you may only choose 1 schema:

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're not using specific schemas, you don't have to fill this advanced option.
{% endhint %}

### Forest Admin can display collections from multiple schemas

To achieve this, proceed to install using 1 of your schemas. Only the models of this schema will be generated in your `models` directory.

Let's take a model example:

{% code title="models/addresses.js" %}
```javascript
// This model was generated by Lumber. However, you remain in control of your models.
// Learn how here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/models/enrich-your-models
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const { Sequelize } = sequelize;
  // This section contains the fields of your model, mapped to your table's columns.
  // Learn more here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v5/reference-guide/models/enrich-your-models#declaring-a-new-field-in-a-model
  const Addresses = sequelize.define('addresses', {
    addressLine: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      field: 'address',
    },
    addressCity: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
    },
    country: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
    },
    createdAt: {
      type: DataTypes.DATE,
    },
  }, {
    tableName: 'addresses',
    underscored: true,
    schema: process.env.DATABASE_SCHEMA,
  });

  return Addresses;
};
```
{% endcode %}

On **line 24**, you'll notice `schema: process.env.DATABASE_SCHEMA`.&#x20;

It uses the environment variable `DATABASE_SCHEMA` set in your **.env** file. \
You'll have to edit this to match your schemas. For instance, if you have 2 schemas:

{% code title=".env" %}
```javascript
DATABASE_SCHEMA_1: name_of_the_first_schema
DATABASE_SCHEMA_2: name_of_the_second_schema
```
{% endcode %}

Once this is done, follow those steps:

#### Step 1: Edit your current models

Because you have changed your environment variable name from `DATABASE_SCHEMA` to `DATABASE_SCHEMA_1`, you need to update it in all your models' file in the `models` directory (same line as line 24 in the above example).

#### Step 2: Create new models

For each of your other schemas' models, you'll need to create a file in `models`. This must be done **manually** and the schema line must be set to `DATABASE_SCHEMA_2` as per above example.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your other schemas have a lot of models, a quick way to generate the models is to create a another project using those other schemas (1 project for each schema).
{% endhint %}
