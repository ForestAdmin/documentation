First, please ensure you have an AWS account. You can sign up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### 1. Launch an EC2 Instance:

- Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click on `Launch Instance`.
- Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) such as `Amazon Linux 2023 AMI`.
- Select `t2.micro` (part of the AWS Free Tier).
- Select `Proceed without a key pair`

![](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy-on-aws-key-pair.png)

- On the `Configure Security Group` step, create a new security group:
  - allow `ssh traffic`.
  - allow `HTTPS traffic`.
  - allow `HTTP traffic`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy-on-aws-security-group.png)

- Review and launch the instance.

### 2. Connect to the EC2 instance:

- Navigate to your EC2 instance and click on `Connect`.
- Leave the default parameters and click on `Connect` again.
- Your are now connected to your instance.

### 3. Set up your instance:

{% hint style="info" %}
The command lines in this step demonstrate how to install a Node.js agent. If you are running Forest Admin on another agent, please adapt the following to your specific stack.
{% endhint %}

- Update the instance:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

- Install Git:

```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

- Clone your repo:

```bash
git clone your-repo-link
```

- Install Node.js and npm:

```bash
sudo yum install npm -y
```

- Navigate to your project directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd your-repo-directory
npm install
```

- Set up all the necessary environment variables provided by the Forest Admin environment creation wizard.

- Add the `APPLICATION_PORT` environment variable to be able to contact the server from outside. In this example, we will choose `APPLICATION_PORT=3310`. If you choose another port, please adapt the next steps accordingly.

- Start the agent

```bash
npm run start:watch
```

### 4. Adjust security group rules:

- Navigate to your EC2 instance's security group.
- Click on `Edit inbound rules`.
- Add a Custom TCP inbound rule to allow on port `3310`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy-on-aws-inbound-rules.png)

### 5. Create a target group:

- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service.
- Under "Target Groups", click `Create Target Groups`.
- Ensure target type is instance.
- Choose HTTP to `3310`.
- Ensure VPC is set to the same VPC as your EC2 instance.
- Setup the health checks as set to `/forest`.
- On the next step, select instance and click on `Include as pending below`.
- Finally create the target group.

### 6. Request a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):

- Navigate to ACM and click on `Request a certificate`.
- Enter your domain name and validate the domain ownership using DNS validation.
- After viewing the new created certificate, click on `Create records in Route 53`.
- Wait for the certificate to be validated (this can take some time < 1mn).

### 7. Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB):

- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service.
- Under "Load Balancers", click `Create Load Balancer`.
- Choose `Application Load Balancer` and follow the setup.
- Ensure the ALB is set to the same VPC as your EC2 instance.
- Select all regions.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy-on-aws-alb-regions.png)

- Remove default security group and select the group associated to the newly created instance.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy-on-aws-alb-security.png)

- Add an HTTPS listener and choose previously created target group and certificate.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy-on-aws-alb-https-listener.png)

- After creating the ALB copy the `DNS name`.

### 8. Add CNAME to Route53:

- Navigate to Route53 and choose your hosted zone (domain).
- Create a `CNAME` record with the domain name filled in the certificate and the `DNS name` of the ALB.

### 9. Finalize:

Check your domain. You should be able to access your Forest Admin panel environment hosted on AWS. ðŸŽ‰

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a basic setup, and there are many optimizations and security enhancements (like using RDS, tightening security groups, etc.) that can be done for a production-ready deployment. Please refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) to go deeper.
