# Upgrade to v5

{% hint style="warning" %}

Please be aware that while Forest Admin make every effort to ensure that our platform updates are broadly compatible and offer detailed instructions for upgrading, Forest Admin cannot guarantee that custom code developed by the developers will always be compatible with new versions of our software. This includes any custom modifications or extensions to core functionalities, such as method overrides or custom integrations. It is the responsibility of the developers to review and test their custom code to ensure compatibility with each new version. Our team provides comprehensive upgrade guides to assist in this process, but these cannot encompass the unique customizations that may be present in each customer's environment. Therefore, Forest Admin strongly recommend establishing a thorough testing protocol for your specific customizations to safeguard against potential issues during the upgrade process.

{% endhint %}

## Upgrading to v5

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before upgrading to v5, consider the below **breaking changes**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
As for any dependency upgrade, it's very important to **test this upgrade** **in your testing environments**. Not doing so could result in your admin panel being unusable.
{% endhint %}

To upgrade to v5, **update the version in your Gemfile**, then run:

```javascript
bundle install
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of a regression introduced in Production after the upgrade, a rollback to your previous agent version 4 is the fastest way to restore your admin panel.
{% endhint %}

## Breaking changes

### Select all feature

This version also introduces the new Select all behavior. Once you've updated your **bulk** Smart Actions according to the below changes, you'll be able to choose between selecting **all** the records or only those displayed on the current page.

{% code title="/controllers/forest/companies_controller.rb" %}
```javascript
# BEFORE
class Forest::CompaniesController < ForestLiana::SmartActionsController
  def mark_as_live
    company_ids = params.dig('data', 'attributes', 'ids')
    # ...
    render json: { success: 'Companies are now live!' }
  end
end
# AFTER
class Forest::CompaniesController < ForestLiana::SmartActionsController
  def mark_as_live
    company_ids = ForestLiana::ResourcesGetter.get_ids_from_request(params)
    # ...
    render json: { success: 'Companies are now live!' }
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you altered the default DELETE behavior by overriding or extending it, you'll have to do so as well with the new BULK DELETE route.
{% endhint %}
