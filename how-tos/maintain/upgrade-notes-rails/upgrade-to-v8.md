# Upgrade to v8

{% hint style="warning" %}

Please be aware that while Forest Admin make every effort to ensure that our platform updates are broadly compatible and offer detailed instructions for upgrading, Forest Admin cannot guarantee that custom code developed by the developers will always be compatible with new versions of our software. This includes any custom modifications or extensions to core functionalities, such as method overrides or custom integrations. It is the responsibility of the developers to review and test their custom code to ensure compatibility with each new version. Our team provides comprehensive upgrade guides to assist in this process, but these cannot encompass the unique customizations that may be present in each customer's environment. Therefore, Forest Admin strongly recommend establishing a thorough testing protocol for your specific customizations to safeguard against potential issues during the upgrade process.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please follow the recommended procedure to upgrade your agent version by following [this note](../push-your-new-version-to-production.md).
{% endhint %}

This upgrade unlocks the following features:

- Use templating in the filters of Chart components
- Add conditions to your role permissions

## Upgrading to v8

{% hint style="warning" %}
As for any dependency upgrade, it's very important to **test this upgrade** **in your testing environments**. Not doing so could result in your admin panel being unusable.
{% endhint %}

To upgrade to v8, first update your project according to the [_Breaking Changes_](../upgrade-notes-rails/upgrade-to-v8.md#breaking-changes) section below.&#x20;

If you're upgrading from an older version, please make sure you've also read the previous upgrade notes ([v7](upgrade-to-v7.md), [v6](upgrade-to-v6.md),..)

To upgrade to v8, **update the version in your Gemfile**, then run the following and update your project as shown in the _Breaking Changes_ section below.

```javascript
bundle install
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of a regression introduced in Production after the upgrade, a rollback to your previous agent version 7 is the fastest way to restore your admin panel.
{% endhint %}

## Breaking changes

### Roles v2.0

This new version (v8) drops the support of the legacy Roles system (v1.0). If you are this legacy configuration, please follow [this procedure](../migrate-to-the-new-role-system.md) in order to migrate to the new Roles system (v2.0) **before** you attempt to upgrade to version 8.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**How do I know if I'm using the legacy or new Roles system?**

If you have access to Roles (Project settings > Roles) as designed below...\
\
![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)\
\
then you are using the new Role system.
{% endhint %}

### Approval Workflow

{% hint style="danger" %}
This new major version makes the configuration, described below, mandatory to ensure that actions are not triggered directly and approvals requests are properly created for the reviewers.
{% endhint %}

**Whether or not** your project currently uses the Approval Workflow feature,
you must ensure that all your Smart Actions controllers extend from the `ForestLiana::SmartActionsController` controller.

{% code title="controller.rb" %}

```ruby
# NOW in v9, this configuration is mandatory to make approvals work as expected.
class Forest::CompaniesController < ForestLiana::SmartActionsController
  def mark_as_live
    # ...
  end
end
```

{% endcode %}

### Routes override

If your project overrides routes, using the `ForestLiana::PermissionsChecker` to check the permissions, you must replace `PermissionsChecker.new(...)` by `ForestLiana::Ability::forest_authorize!(action, forest_user, @resource)`.

An example can be found [here](../../../reference-guide/routes/override-a-route.md).
