  The purpose of this note is to help developers to upgrade their agent from v5
  to v6. Please read carefully and integrate the following breaking changes to
  ensure a smooth update.â€‹

# Upgrade to v6

## Upgrading to v6

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before upgrading to v5, consider the below **breaking changes**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
As for any dependency upgrade, it's very important to **test this upgrade** **in your testing environments**. Not doing so could result in your admin panel being unusable.
{% endhint %}

To upgrade to v6, **update the version in your Gemfile**, then run the following and update your project as shown in the _Breaking Changes_ section below.:

```javascript
bundle install
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of a regression introduced in Production after the upgrade, a rollback to your previous agent version 5 is the fastest way to restore your admin panel.
{% endhint %}

## Breaking changes

### Easier authentication

The agent version introduces an improved authentication mechanism. The following changes are required:

#### New environment variable

In your `secrets.yml` file, set a `forest_application_url` variable: it must contain your Rails app URL for that environment. Then add the following:

{% code title="config/initializers/forest_liana.rb" %}
```ruby
ForestLiana.application_url = Rails.application.secrets.forest_application_url
```
{% endcode %}

#### New CORS condition

Add `null_regex = Regexp.new(/\Anull\z/)` as a variable and use it in your cors configuration. When using `rack cors`, it should look like this:

```ruby
    null_regex = Regexp.new(/\Anull\z/)

    config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
      allow do
        hostnames = [null_regex, 'localhost:4200', 'app.forestadmin.com', 'localhost:3001']
        hostnames += ENV['CORS_ORIGINS'].split(',') if ENV['CORS_ORIGINS']

        origins hostnames
        resource '*',
          headers: :any,
          methods: :any,
          expose: ['Content-Disposition'],
          credentials: true
      end
    end
```

#### Enable caching

You need to enable caching on your environment to be able to authenticate to Forest Admin. You can do it by running the following command:

```bash
rails dev:cache
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can either enable caching or setup a static clientId as shown in the next step.
{% endhint %}

#### Setup a static clientId

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is required if you're running multiple instances of your agent (with a load balancer for exemple) or if you don't want to enable caching on your environment.
{% endhint %}

First, you will need to obtain a Client ID for your environment by running the following command:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer FOREST_ENV_SECRET" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"token_endpoint_auth_method": "none", "redirect_uris": ["APPLICATION_URL/forest/authentication/callback"]}' \
     https://api.forestadmin.com/oidc/reg
```

Then assign the `client_id` value from the response (it's a JWT) to a `forest_client_id` variable in your `secret.yml` file.

Lastly, add the following:

{% code title="config/initializers/forest_liana.rb" %}
```ruby
ForestLiana.forest_client_id = Rails.application.secrets.forest_client_id
```
{% endcode %}
