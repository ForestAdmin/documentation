  The purpose of this note is to help developers to upgrade their agent from v5
  to v6. Please read carefully and integrate the following breaking changes to
  ensure a smooth upgrade.â€‹

# Upgrade to v6

## Upgrading to v6

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before upgrading to v6, consider the below **breaking changes**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
As for any dependency upgrade, it's very important to **test this upgrade** **in your testing environments**. Not doing so could result in your admin panel being unusable.
{% endhint %}

To upgrade to v6, simply run:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="SQL" %}
```bash
npm install forest-express-sequelize@^6.0.0
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mongodb" %}
```bash
npm install forest-express-mongoose@^6.0.0
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of a regression introduced in Production after the upgrade, a rollback to your previous agent is the fastest way to restore your admin panel.
{% endhint %}

## Breaking changes

### Agent initialization

The agent initialization now **returns a promise**. This solves an issue wherein exposed agents were not yet initialized and thus returning 404s.

You must update the following 2 files:

{% code title="middlewares/forestadmin.js (lines 6-7)" %}
```javascript
// BEFORE
module.exports = function (app) {
  app.use(Liana.init({

// AFTER
module.exports = async function (app) {
  app.use(await Liana.init({
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="app.js (line 56)" %}
```javascript
// BEFORE
resolve: Module => new Module(app),

// AFTER
resolve: Module => Module(app),
```
{% endcode %}

### Select all feature

This version also introduces the new Select all behavior. Once you've updated your **bulk** Smart Actions according to the below changes, you'll be able to choose between selecting **all** the records or only those displayed on the current page.

{% code title="/routes/companies.js" %}
```javascript
//BEFORE
router.post('/actions/mark-as-live', permissionMiddlewareCreator.smartAction(), (req, res) => {
  let companyId = req.body.data.attributes.ids[0];

  return companies
    .update({ status: 'live' }, { where: { id: companyId }})
    .then(() => {
      res.send({ success: 'Company is now live!' });
    });
});

// AFTER
import { RecordsGetter } from "forest-express-sequelize";

...

router.post('/actions/mark-as-live', permissionMiddlewareCreator.smartAction(), (req, res) => {
  return new RecordsGetter(companies).getIdsFromRequest(req)
    .then((companyIds) => {
      return companies
        .update({ status: 'live' }, { where: { id: companyIds }})
        .then(() => {
          res.send({ success: 'Company is now live!' });
        });
    });
});
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you altered the default DELETE behavior by overriding or extending it, you'll have to do so as well with the new [BULK DELETE route](../../../reference-guide/routes/default-routes.md#delete-a-list-of-records).
{% endhint %}
